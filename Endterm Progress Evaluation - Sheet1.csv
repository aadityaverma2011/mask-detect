It was really hard at first and I didn't know where to start, so I started my asking Aun and Divyanshu and they were really helpful. I also learned on kaggle's courses and used ChatGPT to debug all my code to find any errors that I could fix. All in all, this was a really great experience and I hope I can attend future, more advanced bootcamps like these.","No, not really.","Before this class, I thought that AI was only limited to NLPs like ChatGPT. However, AI can be applied in much more fields like healthcare, finance, etc. I learned these applications, what unsupervised and supervised data was and how to code a model from start to finish. These experiences helped grow my experience with AI and DL a lot. I learned a lot of CNNs and ANNs and their use cases. I also advanced my knowledge of Python syntax to the point where it almost feels like English. I also gained exposure to libraries like numpy, matplotlib, pandas, tensorflow, keras, etc. I also learned a lot about the statistics and probabilities involved in machine learning and metrics such as f1 score, accuracy, precision, and confusion matrices to calculate all these. Finally, the culminating project where we had to build a model helped me grow as an DL scientist and a developer, and I will definitely engage in more projects like these in the future.

Not only did they teach the foundations of concepts, but Mr. Pandit also dived into the math behind, which is really important in terms of knowing what's going on and which variable affects which. This is really important in terms of hyperparameter tuning, a key aspect in developing the best models. This program taught me not to take the math behind AI for granted and helped me develop the best model, with a 99% percent. The mentor, Mohd, was also really helpful in terms of getting my application off the ground and doing feasibility checks to make sure that my work won't go to waste. He also helped me whenever I had any errors in my code that I didn't understand properly and helped make my model into a user-friendly application that can be implemented in the clinical workspace. All in all, I'm thankful for everything Better Mind Labs has done for me, as they really taught me a lot and fueled my interest for AI.
